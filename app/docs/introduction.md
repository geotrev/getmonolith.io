Welcome! Undernet is a fully modular, highly configurable set of base CSS styles and interactive UI components. It's also responsive and internationalization-friendly for right-to-left languages.

The framework is extremely light, carrying no external dependencies. It's available via CDN, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/package/undernet), and as a raw download.

Head over to the [download page](/docs/overview/download) to see how you can add Undernet to your project, then learn the [JavaScript](/docs/overview/javascript) and [CSS](/docs/overview/css) patterns that make using the framework a breeze.

## About Undernet

Undernet was created with the goal of simplifying the development experience, allowing the developer to write less CSS, as well as giving an easy JavaScript API for using common interactive UI patterns. 

Over time, lots of new features have been added. These include lots of helper CSS classes and Sass utilities to empower developers in building their interfaces.

Undernet can both be a prototyping tool or the basis for your web app. You can easily pick and choose which elements and components to include, reducing the size of the overall bundle.

### Core Principles

- ðŸ§© **Configuration:** The framework comes with a configuration file enabling full brand control, from global to element-specific styling.
- â™¿ **Accessibility:** Accessibility is baked in to interactive components like dropdowns and modals, to ensure everyone can use your interface.
- ðŸ“¦ **Modularity:** Undernet can act independently from your core stylesheet and can be added to to existing projects using [scopes](/docs/overview/css).
- ðŸš² **Agility:** Installation options range from CDN to hosting the source files yourself.

### Support

Undernet's CSS and JavaScript will work in _recent versions_ these browsers:

- Chrome âœ“
- Firefox âœ“
- Safari âœ“
- Opera âœ“

The framework is also tested in and supports **Internet Explorer 11** and **Edge** (non-chromium) on Windows. Support for IE11 and non-chromium Edge may drop in the near future as the new Edge is rolled out in 2020.
