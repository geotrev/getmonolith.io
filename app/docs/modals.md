Use modals to focus the user experience on a critical task or set of information. Modals have simple base styling, with the contents using a subjective markup structure.

## Basic Modal

Check out this example modal:

<button data-target="new-modal">Open modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header>
      <h2 class="h6 has-no-margin-top" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <a class="button" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="primary button">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>

```html
<button data-target="new-modal">Open modal</button>
```

```html
<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header>
      <h2 class="h6" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        <span class"is-visually-hidden">close modal</span>
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <a class="button" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="primary button" href="#">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>
```

You can have custom contents as well (hence subjective markup). Meaning the header, section, and footer elements will have style from Undernet, but nothing is keeping you from using other elements instead (you may not need a header or footer, for example, and can just use a `div`).

## Long Content

The modal will be able to handle long-content with ease, turning the overlay into a scrollable area.

<button data-target="new-modal-3">Open modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal-3">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal-3" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header>
      <h2 class="h6 has-no-margin-top" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>

    <footer>
      <a class="button" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="primary button">

## Vertical Centering

Adding the `is-centered` class onto the modal overlay will vertically center the modal dialog on the screen.

<button data-target="new-modal-2">Open centered modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay is-centered" data-modal="new-modal-2">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal-2" aria-labelledby="header-id-2">
    <header>
      <h2 class="h6 has-no-margin-top" id="header-id-2">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
      <a class="button" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="primary button">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>

```html
<button data-target="new-modal-2">Open centered modal</button>
```

```html
<div class="modal-overlay is-centered" data-modal="new-modal-2">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal-2" aria-labelledby="header-id-2">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

## Requirements

Two main pieces are required: an API call and correct HTML markup.

### HTML

#### Trigger Attributes

For the modal button, it should have two main properties:

```html
<button data-target="new-modal">Press me</button>
```

- `data-target`: an attribute containing a unique id pointing to the modal overlay's `data-modal` attribute.

#### Modal Attributes

For the modal itself, you need a few more things.

```html
<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header>
      <h2 class="h6" id="header-id">...</h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
        <span class"is-visually-hidden">close modal</span>
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      ...
    </section>
    <footer>
      <a class="button" data-close href="#">...</a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>
```

- `data-modal`: an attribute matching your corresponding button's `data-target` value. Add it to the modal overlay element. overlay.
- `data-parent`: an attribute pointing to the modal wrapper. It should equal the value of the element with `data-modal`.
- `data-close`: an attribute indicating a button or link will close the current modal dialog.

#### Accessibility

The below attributes you should add to elements yourself. They increase the content's accessibility for users with assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

- `aria-hidden`: an attribute that should be attached to any icons (close or otherwise) in the modal. Screen readers are inconsistent with icons, so they should be hidden instead. When using an icon, make sure you have `is-visually-hidden` text describing the action.
- `aria-labelledby`: an attribute to be attached to the `modal-dialog` element. It should have a matching value to the header element's `id`.

[See WAI-ARIA documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) on best-practices for the dialog modal UI pattern.

#### Styling Classes

- `modal-overlay`: gives overlay styling for the modal background.
- `modal-dialog`: container for the dialog's contents.
- `is-centered`: a helper class that vertically centers the modal dialog within the modal overlay.

Edit much of the styling within `_config.scss`.

#### Optional Elements

Each of these elements has corresponding options under `_config.scss`.

- `header`: Use a header tag to get a prestyled header wrapper meant for a title and close icon.
- `section` Use a section tag for inner-content of the modal.
- `footer`: Use a footer tag for a prestyled footer wrapper meant for call-to-actions.

### API

Call one of the following scripts from Undernet's JavaScript (not both!). This should happen _only once_ on page load/component mount/etc.

```js
Undernet.start()
```

```js
Undernet.Modals.start()
```
