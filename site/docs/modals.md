# {{ page.title }}

Use modals to focus the user experience on a critical task or set of information. Modals have simple base styling, with the contents using a semantic markup structure. You can use utility classes or your own custom CSS to style the modal content (including header, footer, and content).

Try to keep the modal dialog as high in the document tree as possible. While the dialog is styled in a way to make it mostly capable of being nested in divs or other wrappers, doing so comes with a risk of interfering with the fullscreen effect of the dialog.

Worth noting: there can only be one modal open at a time. Stacked modals are not supported.

## Basic Modal

Check out this example modal:

<button data-target="new-modal">Open modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-space-between has-align-items-center">
      <h2 class="h5 has-no-m" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a class="has-font-size-sm" data-close href="#">
        Close
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-flex-end">
      <a class="button has-no-m-block-end has-m-inline-end-sm" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="button is-primary has-no-m-block-end">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>

```html
<button data-target="modal-id">Open modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="modal-id">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="modal-id" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-space-between has-align-items-center">
      <h2 class="h5 has-no-m" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a class="has-font-size-sm" data-close href="#">
        Close
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-flex-end">
      <a class="button has-no-m-block-end has-m-inline-end-sm" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="button is-primary has-no-m-block-end">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Long Content

The modal will be able to handle long-content with ease, turning the overlay into a scrollable area.

<button data-target="new-modal-3">Open long-content modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="new-modal-3">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal-3" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-space-between has-align-items-center">
      <h2 class="h5 has-no-m" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a class="has-font-size-sm" data-close href="#">
        Close
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>

    <footer class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-flex-end">
      <a class="button has-no-m-block-end has-m-inline-end-sm" data-close href="#">
        Cancel

## Dialog Positioning

By adding flex modifier classes onto the overlay, you can position the dialog within its overlay.

For example, to center the dialog, add `is-d-flex has-align-items-center` to the overlay (wrapper) element.

<button data-target="new-modal-2">Open centered modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay is-d-flex has-align-items-center" data-modal="new-modal-2">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="new-modal-2" aria-labelledby="header-id-2">
    <header class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-space-between has-align-items-center">
      <h2 class="h5 has-no-m" id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a class="has-font-size-sm" data-close href="#">
        Close
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Some modal content here</p>
    </section>
    <footer class="is-d-flex has-justify-content-flex-end">
      <a class="button has-no-m-block-end has-m-inline-end-sm" data-close href="#">
        Cancel
      </a>
      <a class="button is-primary has-no-m-block-end">
        OK
      </a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>

```html
<button data-target="modal-id">Open centered modal</button>

<div class="modal-overlay is-d-flex has-align-items-center" data-modal="modal-id">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="modal-id" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```

## Requirements

Two main pieces are required: an API call and correct HTML markup.

### HTML

#### Trigger Attributes

For the modal button, it should have two main properties:

```html
<button data-target="modal-id">Press me</button>
```

- `data-target`: an attribute containing a unique id pointing to the modal overlay's `data-modal` attribute.

#### Modal Attributes

For the modal itself, you can add a few more things.

```html
<div class="modal-overlay" data-modal="modal-id">
  <div class="modal-dialog" data-parent="modal-id" aria-labelledby="header-id">
    <header>
      <h2 id="header-id">
        Modal Header
      </h2>
      <a data-close href="#">
        Close
      </a>
    </header>
    <section>
      ...
    </section>
    <footer>
      <a data-close href="#">...</a>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>
```

While optional, using `header` and `footer` elements provides semantic meaning for the dialog. It's highly recommended to use this structure.

- `data-modal`: an attribute with a value matching its trigger element's `data-target` attribute.
- `data-parent`: an attribute pointing to the modal wrapper. It should equal the value of the element with `data-modal`.
- `data-close`: an attribute indicating a button or link will close the active modal dialog.

#### Accessibility

The below attributes you should add to elements yourself. They increase the content's accessibility for users with assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

- `aria-hidden`: an attribute that should be attached to any icons (close or otherwise) in the modal, such as a "close" icon (in lieu of text). Screen readers are inconsistent with icons, so they should be hidden instead. When using an icon, make sure you have `is-visually-hidden` text describing the action.
- `aria-labelledby`: an attribute to be attached to the `modal-dialog` element. It should have a matching value to the header element's `id`.

[See WAI-ARIA documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) on best-practices for the dialog modal UI pattern.

#### Styling Classes

- `modal-overlay`: adds overlay styling for the modal background.
- `modal-dialog`: the container for dialog content.

Edit much of the styling within `_config.scss`.
